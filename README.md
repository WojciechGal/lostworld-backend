To build and run the application from a fresh clone of this repo:

## Configure MySQL

1. Create a database in your MySQL instance.
2. Update the application.properties file in the `src/main/resources` folder with the URL, username and password for your MySQL instance. The table schema for the Todo objects will be created for you in the database.


## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `pl.lostworld.lostworldbackend.LostworldBackendApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
